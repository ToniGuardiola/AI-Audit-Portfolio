# AI Tool Risk Classification – Module 4

** Name:** Maria-Antònia Guardiola

**Institution / Organisation:** Ins Premià de Mar  
**Job Title / Role:** AI Governance Officer  


## 1. Name of AI System
Google Docs’ Smart Compose


## 2. What Does It Do?
Smart Compose is an AI writing assistant embedded within Google Docs. It uses predictive algorithms and natural language processing to suggest complete sentence fragments as users type. 

- **Who uses it?** Primarily students and teachers.
- **What decisions does it support or automate?** It automates text prediction, improving writing fluency and speed.
- **What kind of data does it process?** Typed text (real-time input), possibly reflecting personal views, learning level, or writing habits.


## 3. Risk Classification
- [ ] Minimal Risk  
- [x] Limited (Medium) Risk  
- [ ] High Risk  
- [ ] Unacceptable Risk  
- [ ] It Depends


## 4. Justification
The tool does not make any educational decisions, grade students, or determine outcomes. It merely suggests text and can be ignored by the user. It does not process sensitive or biometric data, and users (students/teachers) remain fully in control. However, since it interacts directly with learners and could subtly shape their expression or understanding over time, it requires transparency.

- No automated decisions impacting rights or access
- No biometric or special category data used
- Human fully in control
- Limited educational impact
- Transparency required to inform users that AI suggestions are present


## 5. Reflection (Optional but Recommended)
If misclassified as minimal risk, the school might skip informing users that they are interacting with AI, which could undermine trust or confuse students. If overused, it could potentially limit students’ development of original writing skills.

**Recommended safeguards:**
- Display a message that Smart Compose is AI-generated
- Offer an option to disable the feature for young learners
- Train teachers to guide students in using such tools critically
