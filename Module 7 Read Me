# Module 7: Monitoring, Auditing, and Continuous Improvement

This repository contains my portfolio work for **Module 7** of the Kompass Education *Certified AI Governance Officer* course. The module focuses on post-deployment responsibilities: how to monitor AI systems, conduct internal audits and implement continuous improvement strategies to ensure legal compliance and ethical performance over time.

## Contents

- **MonitoringPlan/**  
  Contains a detailed Monitoring Plan for an AI-powered grading tool used in a high school setting (ages 12-18). The plan outlines key performance and governance metrics, responsible roles, data collection methods and review frequency.

- **AuditReport/** 
  Will include a completed internal AI Audit Checklist and a summary report identifying risks, findings and remediation steps.

- **ContinuousImprovement/**   
  Will provide a practical improvement framework or case study showing how monitoring and audit insights can drive iterative improvement in the school context.

- **DashboardPrototype/**   
  Will show how key technical, ethical, and compliance metrics can be visualized in a dashboard for easier ongoing governance.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how I apply the principles of ongoing monitoring, auditing and adaptive improvement to the real-world use of AI tools in secondary education. All work reflects current best practices under the **EU AI Act** (e.g. Article 17 - Quality Management System) and **GDPR** (e.g. ongoing accountability and privacy compliance).

By including these artifacts, I aim to show that I can translate legal and ethical requirements into practical, school-based governance toolsâ€”contributing to safer, fairer and more transparent AI use for students and staff.
