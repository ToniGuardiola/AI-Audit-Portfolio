# AI Audit Checklist: EduScan System

This checklist is designed for internal auditing of the EduScan AI system used in a school environment. It helps ensure legal compliance, ethical use, and operational effectiveness, in alignment with the EU AI Act and GDPR.



## 1. Data and Privacy Compliance ✅

- [ ] Is the AI system only accessing approved data sources?
- [ ] Are all personal data categories documented and legally justified?
- [ ] Are data retention periods defined and enforced?
- [ ] Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been completed or updated?
- [ ] Are all user consents (e.g. from parents/students) documented and current?
- [ ] Are there procedures in place for data subject rights (access, deletion, correction)?
- [ ] Is any sensitive data being processed (e.g. biometrics, learning difficulties)?
  - [ ] If yes, is explicit consent obtained and logged?
- [ ] Are data minimization and purpose limitation principles being followed?



## 2. Algorithmic Performance & Reliability ✅

- [ ] Are current performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, error rate) tracked and documented?
- [ ] Are results regularly compared to human benchmarks (e.g. teacher assessments)?
- [ ] Have significant errors or malfunctions been logged and addressed?
- [ ] Has the model been updated or retrained in the last 12 months?
- [ ] Are fallback processes in place if the AI system fails?



## 3. Fairness and Bias Checks ✅

- [ ] Are outputs audited for potential bias by student demographic group?
- [ ] Are there known disparities in system performance?
- [ ] Are mitigation strategies in place to reduce bias (e.g. diverse training data)?
- [ ] Has the system been tested on underrepresented or vulnerable groups?
- [ ] Are teachers or staff able to override biased or inappropriate outputs?



## 4. Human Oversight & Governance ✅

- [ ] Is human review in place for high-impact decisions (e.g. risk predictions, grading)?
- [ ] Do teachers understand when and how to override AI decisions?
- [ ] Are there clear internal processes to report issues or concerns?
- [ ] Is a designated AI Governance Officer responsible for oversight?
- [ ] Has staff received training on responsible AI use?



## 5. Documentation and Regulatory Readiness ✅

- [ ] Are system manuals, technical specifications, and vendor documentation up to date?
- [ ] Are all Article 13 and GDPR transparency documents publicly available?
- [ ] Is the provider complying with EU AI Act obligations (logging, record-keeping)?
- [ ] Is there a local record of significant AI incidents or interventions?
- [ ] Would you be able to demonstrate compliance if audited externally tomorrow?



## 6. Recent Changes or Risks ✅

- [ ] Have there been any system updates or model changes in the last 6 months?
- [ ] Did those changes trigger new risks or require new consents?
- [ ] Was the DPIA reviewed in response to any updates?
