# Internal Audit Report: EduScan AI System  
**Date of Audit:** 2025-08-08  
**Auditor(s):** Maria-Antònia Guardiola, AI Governance Officer


## 1. Overview

This internal audit evaluated the EduScan AI system used in INS Premià de Mar to assist with formative feedback on student writing. The objective was to assess compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR), alignment with EU AI Act obligations (Articles 13, 17, 29) and identify any performance, bias or governance risks that may require action.



## 2. Scope and Method

The audit covered:
- Data access and retention practices
- Algorithmic performance and transparency
- Fairness and bias across demographics
- Human oversight procedures
- Documentation and regulatory readiness

The standard AI Governance Audit Checklist was used, and supporting documentation from the provider was reviewed (technical manuals, DPIA, Article 13 instructions). Input was also gathered from two teachers using EduScan regularly.



## 3. Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
- EduScan only processes limited text data and stores no sensitive personal identifiers.
- The DPIA was completed prior to deployment and reviewed last semester.
- Teachers consistently review AI feedback before sharing with students.
- Audit logs and error tracking are in place and accessible.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Bias Risk:** Some AI-generated comments appear less accurate for non-native English writers. The error rate for this group was ~8% higher than average.
- **Transparency Gaps:** While an Article 13 notice is available, it lacks detail about known limitations and known vendor-side risks.
- **Documentation:** The provider’s technical documentation does not currently explain retraining cycles or update mechanisms.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** No formal process for students or parents to raise concerns or misunderstandings about AI outputs exists.



## 4. Recommendations

| Issue | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| Bias in feedback | Raise with vendor; request diverse dataset retraining | AI Gov Officer | 2025-09-01 |

| Create student feedback form | Add link to EduScan dashboard for issue reporting | IT & Comms | 2025-08-30 |



## 5. Next Steps

- Share findings with the teaching staff during next AI review meeting.
- Store checklist and this report in the audit documentation folder.
- Schedule re-audit in January 2026 or sooner if significant model changes occur.



## 6. Audit Confidence

✅ This system is currently deemed **low risk**, assuming recommended improvements are implemented. No severe compliance issues or safety concerns were found.
